Then, click on "Security and Login" from the left-hand menu.
Look for "Apps and Websites" and click on it.
Step 3: Remove Musiversal App
You will see a list of all the apps and websites you have linked with your Facebook account.
Search for "Musiversal" in the search bar.
Click on "Musiversal" to view its details.
Scroll down and click on "Remove" to remove the app.

What Happens After Removal
